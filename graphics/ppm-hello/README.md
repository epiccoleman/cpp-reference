# ppm-hello 

"Graphics hello world" example for Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend. 

Generates a gradient image.

PPM is a really easy image format - it has a 3 line header at the top, then it's just pixel rgb values on each line.

For simplicity the code just outputs to stdout. Direct the out to `test.ppm` or somesuch. 

`build.sh` handles all this for you.
