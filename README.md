# C++ Reference

This is a repo with some examples of C++. There are a few different Hello World examples, and some kata/sandbox code from me. Mostly made this for myself as a quick reference as I knock the rust off my C++.

Also included in the `cppHello` directory is a copy of a repo from a coworker. It's got a kata from him, a more involved hello world example, and a Dockerfile for running C++ code. I've made some modifications to the Dockerfile, but it's mostly RJ's - original repo linked in that README.md.
