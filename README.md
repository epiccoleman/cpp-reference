# C++ Reference

This is a repo with some examples of C++. There are a few different Hello World examples, and some kata/sandbox code from me. Mostly made this for myself as a quick reference as I knock the rust off my C++.


Directories, listed in approximate order of complexity:

* `dumb-hello` - simplest example, just uses g++.
* `make-hello` - same hello world example, but with a makefile
* `cmake-hello` - same hello world example, but with CMake
* `cmake-docker-hello` - CMake hello world with scripts for running in Docker
* `evercraft-kata` - Evercraft Kata, a more in depth example. 

Also included in the `cppHello` directory is a copy of a repo from a coworker. It's got a kata from him, a more involved hello world example, and a Dockerfile for running C++ code. I've made some modifications to the Dockerfile, which appear wherever I use Docker in this repo, but it's mostly RJ's original repo, which linked in the README.md for that directory.
