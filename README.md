# C++ Reference

This is a repo with some examples of C++. There are a few different Hello World examples, and some kata/sandbox code from me. Mostly made this for myself as a quick reference as I knock the rust off my C++.


Directories, listed in approximate order of complexity:

* `basics/dumb-hello` - simplest example, just uses g++.
* `basics/make-hello` - same hello world example, but with a makefile
* `basics/cmake-hello` - same hello world example, but with CMake
* `basics/cmake-docker-hello` - CMake hello world with scripts for running in Docker
* `basics/cppHello` - copy of RJ's basic C++ repo, see README

* `evercraft-kata` - Evercraft Kata, a more in depth example. 
* `graphics/ppm-hello` - from Ray Tracing In One Weekend, writes out a PPM file
